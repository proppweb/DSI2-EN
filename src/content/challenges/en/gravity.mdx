Gravity is closely related to human physiology, posture, movements, and maintaining position. In Space, microgravity is almost zero and produces profound alterations in the body and objects that surround us.

Space Design is tasked with designing new habitats and equipment that can be used as “countermeasures” to the negative effects of reduced gravity, considering it a potential benefit to innovate and not a limitation to be overcome.
