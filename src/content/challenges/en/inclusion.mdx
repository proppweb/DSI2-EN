Space cancels diversity. Because microgravity makes our bodies disabled. At first, we move with difficulty, we are not used to being weightless. It is like being born again.

Creating inclusive space projects means redefining a “new normal” for a “new environment” governed by physical laws different from those we know. In this evolved scenario, a “prosthetic object” is not something that replaces a leg or an arm, but a tool to improve the adaptability and performance of humans in Space.
