Cosmic space is characterized by extreme conditions, prohibitive for humans beings. The main ones are: lack of atmosphere, high temperature ranges, and solar radiation. 

Space Design has the task of protecting humans from the hostile environment and ensuring survival. It creates “shells”, security envelopes, that can take the form of an extraterrestrial habitat, a rover to explore the territory, a piece of clothing, such as an extravehicular suit, or equipment, such as a helmet.
