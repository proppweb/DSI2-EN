In Space, the changing geometry of gravity draws a cognitive, physical and spatial displacement. Weightlessness affects the mechanisms of proprioception. The body experiences a different postural adaptation than on Earth.

The calibration of forces to pick up an object must be reshaped and dampened: gestures are soft, movements slowed and more conscious, more directed to action, more studied because unseen and to be observed.
