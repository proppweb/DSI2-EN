Space is governed by physical laws different from those on Earth that favour life. The absence of an atmosphere, high temperature ranges, solar radiation and exposure to frequent meteorite impacts are the conditions Space Design to ensure a comfortable stay even in an extreme environment.

The most difficult but necessary challenge for interplanetary human exploration is to devise a living system capable of behaving as an autonomous organism, particularly with regard to non-renewable resources and logistical support, consisting of living cells and service modules capable of generating energy, air, water, food, and completely recycling waste.

Equally fundamental will be the realisation of a complete and sustainable cycle of food cultivation, preparation, consumption and storage and the development of local production of building elements and equipment using 3D printers and exploiting native materials such as regolith to minimise the amount of material transported from Earth, reducing costs and logistical dependencies.
