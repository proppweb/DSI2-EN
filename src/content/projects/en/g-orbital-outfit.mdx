Design not only finds new applications and uses for technologies, but also adds beauty. The G+ Orbital Outfit is a sculptural creation of the innovative G+Thermo Colmar textile application in which Graphene G+ is printed on the wadding that padded the ski jacket using a hexagonal structure pattern to evenly distribute the heat produced by the body and ensure more efficient thermoregulation.

This project is an opportunity to reflect on the role of new technologies in relation to fashion, which increasingly considers innovation as a value to be integrated into its production processes, especially when tailoring. Wondering how space technology innovation can influence people's behaviour and habits and how to become more aware of this process of transformation is the task of design, which through its creations can help bring Space closer to Earth and inspire companies to improve their products to make them more comfortable and performing. The dress closed the Colmar AW 2019 catwalk.
