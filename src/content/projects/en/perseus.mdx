Creating personal space in confined environments to ensure privacy is a very difficult challenge that requires innovative technologies such as augmented reality and AI to change the perception of space.

Perseus Virtual Personal Space is an innovative wearable project that integrates with the intelligent environment of the Cislunar <em>Gateway</em> station, allowing astronauts to isolate themselves from the space shared with the crew, guaranteeing privacy, relaxation, but also the possibility to control the operating system connected to the station - for example, to rebalance circadian rhythms by modifying the quality of day and night lighting - and to communicate with loved ones on Earth. The wearable device is attached to the walls of the International Space Station module and allows the astronaut to relax and communicate with home during off-hours, isolating only the head and amplifying the astronaut's senses. It is inspired by the ancient Greek story of Perseus, who defeated the snake-headed monster Medusa with a helmet that made its wearer invisible.

The shape of the helmet and all its components are designed to provide sensitive noise reduction to create a virtual environment that can help astronauts fall asleep and dream. Inside the helmet, the back of the helmet houses the head, while the front consists of a special pair of augmented reality glasses. The body is held in place by a comfortable belt and a suit with cushions and a backrest to give astronauts the feeling of being wrapped in a sleeping bag.

This design could have a number of applications on Earth in the diagnostic and healthcare sectors, making patients more comfortable and relaxed and analysis more accurate, or it could be used in crowded public places and on transport vehicles to provide some privacy.
