In Space astronauts must devote at least two hours daily to physical exercise to maintain muscle mass and counteract bone decalcification caused by the absence of gravity and the lack of explosive impact, such as that provided by normal walking on Earth. On board the International Space Station, the crew trains using complex machines such as the Cyclo Ergometer Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS), the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System (TVIS), and the Advanced Resistive Exercise Machine (ARED), designed to work on upper and lower limbs.

The role of Space Design is to imagine innovative tools that go beyond traditional training systems with the aim of providing higher performance, expanding the variety of exercises and modes of use, activating muscles in different ways, integrating relaxation functions, and making exercise time more engaging and fun.

Exerity is an innovative fitness system that integrates muscle strengthening and stretching exercises, stimulating the lymphatic system and improving circulatory flow through massage, thanks to embossed textures on the surface of the equipment. It can be used with the hands as well as with the feet and allows exercising in pairs, encouraging cooperation and team spirit.
