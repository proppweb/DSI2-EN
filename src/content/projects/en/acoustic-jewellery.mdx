Living in Space in a confined environment means a total lack of natural elements - such as air, water, light, temperature, humidity and the sounds of nature - that are fundamental to our biorhythms. Worsening the situation are the instruments of the International Space Station, which produce a constant, annoying background noise, making it harder for astronauts to concentrate.

Other problems stem from the sense of loneliness caused by the distance from loved ones on Earth and, paradoxically, the need to isolate oneself due to the lack of privacy caused by having to share very small open spaces with other people during all activities, such as carrying out scientific experiments, but also preparing meals and sleeping.

Acoustic Jewellery earphones are worn like jewellery to balance stress levels. They can reproduce natural terrestrial sounds - such as the sound of rain falling on leaves or water flowing in streams, the hiss of the wind, the rustling of branches as we walk through a forest - and reduce the frequency of background noise thanks to a hexagonal texture, allowing quieter communication with family members.

On the soft surface of the earbuds in contact with the ear are three small spheres that correspond to specific reflexology points and that with gentle pressure help promote relaxation.
