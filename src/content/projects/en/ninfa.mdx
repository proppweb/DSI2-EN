In Space confinement and microgravity reduce dopamine levels, due to the absence of natural stimuli and physical contact, leading to neuromuscular damage.
The rigid routines and sterile environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) exacerbate these challenges, often contributing to feelings of detachment and loneliness among astronauts. Until now, the astronauts' well-being has taken a backseat to work-related and performance-driven priorities.

The role of Design for Space is to enhance comfort and alleviate isolation, fostering a more positive and relaxed state of mind. By introducing physical contact through an innovative massage system, it is possible to restore vital sensory connections, improve muscle function, prevent deterioration, and promote overall welfare.
Ninfa is a groundbreaking wearable device designed to support astronaut well-being during long-term space missions. It features a system of straps and vibrating modules strategically placed along the back and arms, delivering continuous relaxation and physical comfort throughout the day.

This visionary design embodies the natural relationship between humans and their environment, delivering both functional and emotional support in the unique and demanding context of space exploration. Inspired by the organic forms of ivy, which envelops and supports structures in a symbiotic embrace, Ninfa aims to nurture a profound connection with nature, reflecting humanity's intrinsic bond with the natural world.
