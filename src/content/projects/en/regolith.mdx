Regolith and other dusts present on the Moon and Mars pose a major problem in the outside/inside transition because during extravehicular activities they adhere to the suit and can then disperse inside the extraterrestrial base, damaging instrumentation, as well as being contaminants and potentially harmful to human life.

Regolith Cleaning Robot sits on the shoulder of the astronaut's extravehicular suit, normally acting as an interface and beacon to quickly communicate with other crew members while exploring the terrain.

Once access has been gained to the locker for the transition from the outside to the inside, and before undressing begins, the intelligent robot activates its function by moving along the surface of the suit to remove any remaining regolith stuck to it, thanks to a system of micro-suction cups that keep it adherent to the fabric allowing it to glide, while micro-suction cups and special rotating brushes remove debris and clean the surface of the suit.
