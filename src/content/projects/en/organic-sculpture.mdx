Space Design has the power to add beauty to technology and to transform the lack of gravity, considered a limitation, into an opportunity, by creating environmental and tool-based solutions that could not exist on Earth and that offer new ways of inhabiting and using objects, understood as body extensions to amplify comfort and performance in Space. 

Organic Sculpture is a prosthetic object that replaces a leg. Applying the Use & Gesture Design (UGD) methodology to analyse the behaviour and movements of the body underwater, which are very similar to those assumed in microgravity, this project is inspired by the way octopuses use their tentacles, taking advantage of the environmental laws of Space. It allows parastronauts to balance the length of their limbs and anchor themselves to the restraints, the handles on board the International Space Station, thanks to the soft, sphere-shaped appendage that deforms to allow greater grip on different surfaces. The elastic and flexible structure is reminiscent of the DNA molecule, a long double helix spiral, modelled to facilitate faster movements in microgravity.
